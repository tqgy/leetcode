	/**
	 * You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design
	 * an algorithm to print all paths which sum up to that value. Note that it
	 * can be any path in the tree - it does not have to start at the root. pg
	 * 54 SOLUTION Letâ€™s approach this problem by simplifying it. What if the
	 * path had to start at the root? In that case, we would have a much easier
	 * problem: Start from the root and branch left and right, computing the sum
	 * thus far on each path. When we find the sum, we print the current path.
	 * Note that we donâ€™t stop just because we found the sum. Why? Because we
	 * could have the following path (assume we are looking for the sum 5): 2 +
	 * 3 + â€? + 3 + 1 + 2. If we stopped once we hit 2 + 3, weâ€™d miss several
	 * paths (2 + 3 + -4 + 3 + 1 and 3 + -4 + 3 + 1 + 2). So, we keep going
	 * along every possible path. Now, what if the path can start anywhere? In
	 * that case, we make a small modification. On every node, we look â€œupâ€?to
	 * see if weâ€™ve found the sum. That isâ€”rather than asking â€œdoes this node
	 * start a path with the sum?,â€?we ask â€œdoes this node complete a path with
	 * the sum?â€?
